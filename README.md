# Resume-Builder-JS-HTML-CSS
Build your resume by adding your personal, work information, and converting it all into a fully utilisable Resume.

# whats to come:
- more past work experience text fields
- include the github button link in the final resume file
- avoid having to use a linebreak (<br>) inside text fields
- potentially adding more validation sophistication and requirements to the inputs
- anything else that comes to mind
