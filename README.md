# Resume-Builder-JS-HTML-CSS
Build your resume by adding your personal, work information, and converting it all into a fully utilisable Resume.

# whats to come:
- more past work experience text fields
- include the github button link in the final resume file
- avoid having to use a linebreak ``(<br>)`` inside text fields 
- potentially adding more validation sophistication and requirements to the inputs
- anything else that comes to mind


note: as of yet if you decide to use bullet points or "-" to list skills or particularities of your work experience
you have to use a linebreak at the end of the line otherwise it will mash it all up together, planning to fix this soon
sorry for the inconvenience
